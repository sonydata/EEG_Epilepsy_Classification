# EEG_Epilepsy_Classification
Final group project aiming to identify epilepsy from EEG signals using machine learning models 

**Dataset:  TUH EEG Epilepsy Corpus v2.0.1**

Subjects were sorted into epilepsy and no epilepsy categories by searching
the associated EEG reports for indications as to an epilepsy/no epilepsy 
diagnosis based on clinical history, medications at the time of recording, 
and EEG features associated with epilepsy such as spike and sharp waves.
A board-certified neurologist, Daniel Goldenholz, and his research team
reviewed and verified the decisions about each patient.
